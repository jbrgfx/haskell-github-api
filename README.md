The package is complex, so examples help familiarize users with some basics.
The samples packaged with the source code are not yet up-date, so these examples show demonstrate simple use-cases.
The source files have been renamed for ease of use and occasionally moved. Implementations are not obvious but can be quite simple.

# Getting started
Clone the repo, get dependences using stack build, and then
load scripts into ghci using commands like the following from the project root:
```
   $ stack ghci src/Main.hs
   *Main> main
```
Change the references to users and repos to match those that hold interest to you.
